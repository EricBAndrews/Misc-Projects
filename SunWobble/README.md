## Sun Wobble

A simple program to model the radial velocity of the Sun based on the gravitational forces of the planets. Written in about an hour for a survey Astronomy class, mostly based on modifications of code from [here](https://jakevdp.github.io/blog/2012/08/18/matplotlib-animation-tutorial/).

Radial velocities are an approximation based on mass and semimajor axis.
